# Entity Relationships in Plain Terms

## The People
1. There's a Husband and a Wife. They're at the center of this whole setup.

## The Companies and Trusts
2. Family Trust: This is like a big financial pot for the family's benefit.
3. Family Trust Trustee Company: This company is in charge of managing the Family Trust.
4. Self-Managed Superannuation Fund (SMSF): This is the couple's personal retirement savings fund.
5. SMSF Trustee Company: This is a special company set up just to manage the SMSF.
6. Trading Business Company: This is the actual business that makes money.

## How Everything is Connected

### The People and the Trusts/Funds
- The Husband and Wife are the key people in the SMSF. It's their retirement money.
- They can also benefit from the Family Trust.

### The People and the Companies
- The Husband and Wife are in charge of all the companies:
  - They run (are directors of) and own (are shareholders of) the Family Trust Trustee Company.
  - They also run and own the SMSF Trustee Company.
  - They're the bosses (directors) of the Trading Business Company too.

### The Trusts/Funds and the Companies
- The Family Trust Trustee Company is in charge of managing the Family Trust.
- The SMSF Trustee Company is responsible for managing the SMSF.
- The Family Trust owns the Trading Business Company.

In simpler terms, the Husband and Wife have set up a structure where they control everything, but different parts of their wealth are kept separate for legal and tax reasons. They manage their family's general wealth through the Family Trust, their retirement savings through the SMSF, and their active business through the Trading Business Company.
